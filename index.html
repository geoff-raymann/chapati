            <article id="Descrip">
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Chapatis are made from wheat flour. The flour is usually powdered to allow easy baking process or whiskying when making other baked foods <span id="foods">(Cakes, buns, breads, doughnuts etc)</span> . Chapaties are usually considered a carbohydrate. They form into round shapes. The sizes of the shapes depends on the chef. I usually prefer medium sizes. <blockquote>People usually say that hot water makes hard chapatis but maybe it is because they never tried using it. I have never seen them make soft chapatis with cold water anyway </blockquote><b><i>Use hot water if you need soft chapatis... </i></b> I do not know your favourite stew. But mine is <span id="favoritestew">Zaire beans. Well prepaired</span> </p>
